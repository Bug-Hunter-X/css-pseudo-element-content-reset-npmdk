The solution to prevent the content from being cleared involves separating the hover styles so they don't conflict with the pseudo-element styles. A proper solution is to avoid having `content: '';` in the hover style which is the culprit for the content being cleared.

Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container::before {
  content: "Important Note!";
  display: block;
  color: blue;
}

.container:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```
This version correctly maintains the 'Important Note!' content, even on hover, as the hover style now doesn't override the content of the `::before` pseudo-element.

The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where a pseudo-element's content is unexpectedly empty, despite having content specified. This can happen when the selector's specificity is too low, leading to an overriding rule unintentionally clearing the content.  The `::before` pseudo-element should show 'Important Note!', but remains empty due to the conflicting styles.

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container::before {
  content: "Important Note!";
  display: block;
  color: blue;
}

.container:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen;
  /* This rule unintentionally clears the pseudo-element content due to higher specificity*/
  content: '';
}
```
